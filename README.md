Pyber Analysis

## **Overview**
  We are looking into rideshare data for V. Isualize for a Company named Pyber where we will be using Python and Pandas to create a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type. We will be also creating a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

## **Results**
  With our results we can see within our DataFrame as shown below that their are considerable differences within rideshare data amongst different city types. We can see that the most rides, total drivers, and total fares lie within urban areas. Rural areas account for the least amount of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. The average fare per ride/driver is inversed in that rural areas have the highest fares in both areas and urban areas account for the least. Suburban areas fall in the middle in all categories.

## Summary
  I have several recommendations for PyBer to improve its business. It seems that there is a bunch a of room for Pyber to grow in all city types. I would look into a sliding scale in terms of fares by time of day based on traffic conditions and supply and demand to maximize affordability and profitability since ridership along with more drivers will help Pyber find more success. I would also look into doing what Uber does and foray into the food delivery business and well as the grocery business to drive revenue. Thirdly, we could also look into the feasibility some rewards program or subscription-based model to drive rider engagement along with incentives for drivers.
